# Presentation
please make the text cells markdown cells (ask the TAs or me if you need help figuring out how)

# Idea
ok but you should say why this is interesting and why you would think that

# Null hypothesis

consistent with Null

# Formula
Missing!


# Data

data processed  correctly, but in the last plot please fix the axis labels (should not be 0 and nothing but age < 37 and age > 37)

# Test

this is a difference between means of samples, so the t test would work. however the distributions are not Gaussian. the t-test assumes Gaussianity and your distributions are not Gaussian. a non parametric test for difference of means is the Mann-Whitney U test (https://www.healthknowledge.org.uk/public-health-textbook/research-methods/1b-statistical-methods/parametric-nonparametric-tests) since the samples is large, the t-test may be ok
here is a list of assumptions the t-test makesÂ https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/073115/what-assumptions-are-made-when-conducting-ttest.asp
