# NOTE: This week's HW was done in collaboration with Tiffany Patafio (tp1600).  We worked together equally on Assignment 3, while I used much of her code for Assignment 4 as reference (we used different data sets).



## Assignment 2

The following chart shows three different research papers taken from peer-reviewed journal PLOS ONE.

| **Statistical Analyses** |  **IV(s)**  |  **IV Type(s)**  |  **DV(s)**  |  **DV Type(s)**  |  **Control Variable(s)**  |  **Control Var Type(s)**  |  **Question TBA**  |  **Null Hypothesis**  |  **Alpha**  | **Link to Paper**|                   
|:--------------------:|:-----|:----------|:-----|:----------|:-------------------|:-------------------|:------------|:---------------:|:---------------:|:-----|
| Logistic Regression | Height of tree cavity | Interval | Population of Leisler's bat (Nyctalus leisleri) | Ratio | N/A | N/A | Does the probability of Leisler's bat presence increase with an increase in tree cavity entrance height? | The ratio of occupied to non-occupied cavities is the same or decreases with a decrease in cavity height | 0.05 | https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0200742&type=printable |
| Correlation | Sample of observed deposit withdrawals among peers | Count | Probability of bank withdrawal from depositor | Ratio | N/A | N/A | Does a decrease in the correlation between sample of withdrawals decrease the probability of a bank run? | N/A | N/A | (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147268&type=printable) |
| ANOVA | Level of Education | Ordinal | Kessler Psychological Distress Scale | Interval | N/A | N/A | Bivariate relationship between demographic factors and feeling of psychological distress | N/A | N/A | (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0202818&type=printable) |
